A basic Web Server built in Java without the use of any third party libraries.

All the files needed to import directly into eclipse are included. files/ and web.xml are positioned so that the project
can be executed from eclipse. If the project is taken out of eclipse, files/ and web.xml will need to be moved to the 
project's new execution directory.
